# Outline


# From the skeptics...

- Seriously?  *Another* learning objective to squeeze in??
- *Which* statistics course?
- Can't they just pick it up when they need it? 
- In fact, *do* they even need it?


# Outline

- (computational) Reproducibility: 
    - self-contained (source data, code book, wrangling script, analysis script, final reporting)
    - all results replicated (e.g., the code "just works")
    - easy to verify results or update with new data
- Version control
    - maintains the evolution of the project
    - collaboration among multiple contributors
    - self-collaboration with multiple computers
    - branches permit parallel development
- Ethical practice
    - Any analysis may require hundreds of tiny decisions
    - Work products often intended for audience without technical expertise to scrutinize those decisions 
- Academic Preparedness
    - programming is a collaborative sport
    - effective entry point for research participation
- Industry Preparedness
    - programming is a collaborative sport
    - quite common to refresh standard reports 

We often lump together Reproducbility and VC as if they're one in the same and speak of Git(Hub) as a panacea.  They aren't and it isn't, but the investment in good habits with a professional workflow pays off enormously in the long run...
